<p style= "text-align:justify">
<b>Hypothesis</b>: It is hypothesized that alcohol consumption per capita will always increase when the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increases among ASEAN countries, which in this case, it would be Cambodia and Myanmar. In other words, as a country’s GDP in ASEAN grows, there will also be a consistent annual increase in alcohol consumption.

  <span>
    According to the World Health Organization’s Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health (2018), the prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) has risen to approximately 5.1% in Cambodia and 1.9% in Myanmar, contributing to alcohol-related deaths reaching 7% in both countries. Thus, the correlation between gross domestic product (GDP) and alcohol consumption will be studied. In this project, both the data of GDP and alcohol consumption per capita in Cambodia and Myanmar were obtained from the website of Our World in Data. Our World in Data is a well-known non-profit organization that gathers and compiles data from trusted sources like the World Bank, World Health Organization, and the United Nations. And the information undergoes thorough review and frequent updates, ensuring its reliability for economic and social analysis. In this case, the data were originally collected by the World Bank and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to promote sustainable economic growth of all countries.

    Table 1.0 and Chart 1.0 illustrate the gross domestic product (GDP) and the alcohol consumption per capita for Cambodia from 2010 to 2020. The gross domestic product (GDP) data has been sorted according to ascending order. If the data completely supports the hypothesis, we will see a perfect figure showing a continuous increase in alcohol consumption as the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country increase. However, the data shows that in the year 2020, alcohol consumption has reduced while the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country continues to increase. Thus, the data does not support the hypothesis.

    Table 2.0 and chart 2.0 illustrates the gross domestic product (GDP) and the alcohol consumption per capita for Myanmar from 2010 to 2020. The gross domestic product (GDP) data has been sorted according to ascending order. If the data fully supported the hypothesis, we could see a perfect figure demonstrating the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) so as the rise in alcohol consumption per capita. According to the hypothesis, when a country's gross domestic product (GDP) increases, alcohol consumption will always increase. It is true that as a country's gross domestic product (GDP) increases, alcohol consumption per capita also increases. Thus, the data support the hypothesis.

<h1 style="color:#0b1a53;text-align:center;;background-color:#def2f8">  Conclusion  </h1>

<p style= "text-align:justify">
We hypothesized that as a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased, so would alcohol consumption per capita in the ASEAN countries, specifically Cambodia and Myanmar. However, this continuous uptrend only appeared in Myanmar where both the alcohol consumption and GDP rose in every year, but not in Cambodia, as there was a significant drop in alcohol consumption during 2020 although the GDP rose. Thus, the hypothesis is rejected, as the data contradicts our hypothesis. The available data suggests that our hypothesis is refuted, but it is not strongly refuted due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. An explanation for this is that in 2020, the pandemic led to economic disruptions, lockdowns and health concerns, which subsequently caused a reduction in alcohol consumption. Thus, our prediction that the alcohol consumption per capita will always increase as GDP increases is not guaranteed to come true. Finally, in order to improve accuracy and our analysis, a way to do so would be using data in a time intervals without major economic disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
